## Overview
### Description
This app will be able to used by commuters or travelers who are looking for places to park where it is hard to find parking. This includes urban areas such as cities where the population is only increasing. By pulling in data based on the user's current location, or one they that input, the app will be able to show the user a list of parking facilities that are most convenient to park at.  

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Travel/Productivity
- **Mobile:** Maps, Location, Real-Time
- **Story:** This app will be able to be used by commuters and travelers who are looking for parking spots around their areas and it will be highly useful. This product would be received well.
- **Market:** Most everyone will or has needed to find a parking spot in their lifetime especially in the US, so I think that this app will be pretty useful especially in places with high population density.
- **Habit:** Whenever people are in need of parking or need to find a place to park, which may be often, this app will help guide them. If we make the UI appealing enough and the functionality fast, we will be able to create a good user experience.
- **Scope:** This app will be pretty technically challenging, however we do have different aspects and features of the app that we do have in mind to complete that are feasible, and then others that will make the app better albeit are not as feasible. The stripped down version will still be interesting to build.
